# POSH_Functions

Various PowerShell functions that I have created over time.

* **Export-SessionHistory** - Wrapper for the Get-History command, it will export it a file in CSV fomat.
* **Lock-Workstation** - Simple function to lock the screen in windows _(Same effect as pressing the Windows Key + L combo)_. Can be useful for running at the end of an interactive script.
* **Test-RegistryItem** - Function to test if a item in the registry is a specific value.
